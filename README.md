This is a smaller portion of a larger project done in collaboration with classmates: a gesture-based UI to automate certain actions on Windows. This repository only contains a demo version of a portion that captures video and identifies preset gestures (fingers held up, rectangle with hands, triangle with hands) from it.

The contour, convex hull points, and major convexity defects are indicated on the visual. This was not present in the full project.

The full project was worked on by multiple people and stored using university resources. As a result, I do not have consent to make the whole project public. Additionally, the rest of the project is largely the work of the other group members.
